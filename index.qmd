### Hi there!

#### I'm Dahham, an instructor and postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine focusing on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). My current work investigates molecular and clinical determinants of biologic therapy outcomes using longitudinal real-world data. Through this research, I aim to reduce trial-and-error treatment approaches and strengthen evidence-based clinical decision-making, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals living with IBD.
